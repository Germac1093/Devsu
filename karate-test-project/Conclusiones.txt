Conclusions - DemoBlaze API Test Project

1. The API endpoints work correctly for user creation and login.

2. The API returns a 200 OK status with an empty body for user creation, instead of the expected 201 Created status with user data.

3. The API does not return a user ID after successful user creation, which is usually expected in RESTful APIs.

4. When invalid credentials are provided, the API still returns a 200 OK status instead of a 401 Unauthorized, which is a potential security issue.

5. It is recommended to update the API to return proper status codes like 201 for successful creation and 401 for unauthorized access.

6. The API should return a user ID when a user is successfully created, to make tracking and managing users easier.

7. Error messages should not include sensitive information, especially in production environments.

8. The API should implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive operations.

9. I learned the importance of correct API status codes and response formats for reliable communication between client and server.

10. I also learned the value of secure API design to avoid unauthorized access and data leaks.

11. Thorough testing, including edge cases and error scenarios, is key to ensuring a stable API.

12. Karate's support for data-driven testing and flexible assertions improves test coverage and efficiency.

13. Keeping clear and complete documentation (e.g., using Swagger or OpenAPI) is essential for better testing and easier integration.

14. I hope this project shows my ability to work with the Karate framework. While my main experience is with RestAssured, I learned a lot from this project and Iâ€™m motivated to keep improving my API testing skills.
