CONCLUSIONS - SAUCEDEMO TEST AUTOMATION

1. The automated test successfully simulates a user journey on saucedemo.com, from login to order confirmation, following a clean and functional "happy path".

2. The modular framework design (with separate utilities, page objects, WebDriver factory, and test layers) ensures good maintainability, reusability, and scalability for future test cases.

3. The configuration file (config.properties) provides flexibility by allowing credentials and browser selection to be modified without touching the code.

4. The test was executed correctly on Firefox and Edge browsers, showing consistent behavior across those environments.

5. The test fails on Chrome due to Google's built-in warnings for weak or commonly known passwords, which interfere with the automation flow. This is not a bug in the test code, but an external security feature of the browser.

6. No assertions were implemented because the test was designed for the "happy path" scenario only. However, this limits the test's ability to validate failure conditions or unexpected behaviors.

7. A screenshot is taken at the end of the test to verify that the success message ("Thank you for your order") is displayed, serving as visual proof of test completion.

8. The test can be executed easily from the terminal using Maven (`mvnw clean test`), making it CI/CD ready for future integration.

9. The required environment setup (Java 21.0.7 and Maven 3.9.7) ensures consistency across development and testing environments.

Overall, the project demonstrates a solid structure for UI automation and meets its functional testing objective successfully.
